This project is an website containing some easy and delicious brazilian recipes where I practice all my progress on HTML.

I'll use all the tags I've learned until now, from the text tags to the links and images tags which will take me to other pages inside the website. I'll also use the lists tags which will make the website easier to understand. I'll use the image tag to show the recipe.
